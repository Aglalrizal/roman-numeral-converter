                    Roman numerals are a numeral system that originated in ancient Rome and remained the usual way of
                    writing numbers throughout Europe well into the Late Middle Ages. Numbers are written with
                    combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet, each with a fixed integer value. The modern style
                    uses only these seven:
                    <table border="1">
                        <tr>
                            <th>I</th>
                            <th>V</th>
                            <th>X</th>
                            <th>L</th>
                            <th>C</th>
                            <th>D</th>
                            <th>M</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>1</td>
                            <td>5</td>
                            <td>10</td>
                            <td>50</td>
                            <td>100</td>
                            <td>500</td>
                            <td>1000</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                </p>

                    The use of Roman numerals continued long after the decline of the Roman Empire. From the 14th
                    century on, Roman numerals began to be replaced by Arabic numerals; however, this process was
                    gradual, and the use of Roman numerals persisted in various places, including on clock faces. For
                    instance, on the clock of Big Ben (designed in 1852), the hours from 1 to 12 are written as:
                    I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The notations IV and IX can be read as "one less than five" (4) and "one less than ten" (9),
                    although there is a tradition favouring the representation of "4" as "IIII" on Roman numeral
                    clocks. Other common uses include year numbers on monuments and buildings and copyright dates on the
                    title screens of films and television programmes. MCM, signifying "a thousand, and a hundred less
                    than another thousand", means 1900, so 1912 is written MCMXII. For the years of the current (21st)
                    century, MM indicates 2000; this year is MMXXV (2025).

                    Roman numerals use different symbols for each power of ten, and there is no zero symbol, in contrast
                    with the place value notation of Arabic numerals (in which place-keeping zeros enable the same digit
                    to represent different powers of ten). This allows some flexibility in notation, and there has never
                    been an official or universally
                    accepted standard for Roman numerals.

                    Usage varied greatly in ancient Rome and became thoroughly
                    chaotic in medieval times. The more recent restoration of a largely "classical" notation has gained
                    popularity among some, while variant forms are used by some modern writers as seeking more
                    "flexibility".Roman numerals may be considered legally binding expressions of a number, as in
                    U.S. copyright law before the Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 (where an "incorrect" or
                    ambiguous numeral in a copyright notice could invalidate a copyright claim or affect the termination
                    date of the copyright period).
